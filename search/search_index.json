Accuracy Fully correct, aligns perfectly with all constraints, and hits the goal. Partially correct; contains small factual errors or misses minor constraints. Incorrect, factually wrong, or completely off-target from the prompt goal. Tone Perfectly matched to the requested context and intended audience. Acceptable but the tone is uneven, inconsistent, or slightly generic. Inappropriate, mismatched, or potentially offensive/unprofessional. Creativity Highly original, unique, and compelling execution of the prompt. Contains some novelty or unique phrasing, but relies mostly on standard patterns. Generic, stale, or a predictable regurgitation of common phrases. Structure Impeccably organized with logical flow and helpful formatting (headings, lists). Has a general structure but suffers from minor formatting or flow issues.
