# ✅ Evaluation Criteria

## 📏 Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)

Each project output in this lab journal is evaluated on a 1 to 5 scale across key quality dimensions. These dimensions may vary slightly by project type (e.g., writing, code, design, AI output), but the core rubric remains consistent:

| Metric        | Score 5 (Excellent)                                                                 | Score 3 (Acceptable)                                                                 | Score 1 (Poor)                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity**   | Crystal clear, unambiguous, and immediately understandable.                         | Understandable but contains minor ambiguity or complex phrasing.                    | Confusing, incomplete, or requires significant re-reading or interpretation.   |
| **Accuracy**  | Fully correct, aligns perfectly with all constraints and expectations.              | Partially correct; contains small factual errors or misses minor constraints.       | Incorrect, factually wrong, or off-target from the intended goal.              |
| **Tone**      | Perfectly matched to the intended audience, context, and purpose.                   | Generally appropriate but may be uneven, inconsistent, or slightly generic.         | Inappropriate, mismatched, or unprofessional.                                  |
| **Creativity**| Highly original, compelling, and demonstrates thoughtful or novel execution.        | Some novelty or unique phrasing, but relies mostly on standard patterns.            | Generic, stale, or a predictable regurgitation of common ideas.                |
| **Structure** | Impeccably organized with logical flow and helpful formatting (e.g., headings, lists).| Has a general structure but suffers from minor formatting or flow issues.           | Disorganized, hard to follow, or presented as a wall of text or code.          |

> ℹ️ *Additional dimensions (e.g., Efficiency, Robustness, Modularity) may be added for technical or domain-specific projects.*

## ✅ Compliance Checks

In addition to the 1–5 scoring, each experiment includes a **Compliance** section to track adherence to project-specific constraints, such as:

- Word count or token limits  
- Required or forbidden content (e.g., “Do not add extra details”)  
- Formatting rules (e.g., Markdown only, no images)  
- Style or persona constraints  
- Technical specifications (e.g., compile-ready code, test coverage)

Outputs that violate these constraints may receive deductions or be marked as non-compliant, even if their qualitative scores are high.

## 🧪 Evaluation Notes

- All scores are assigned through **manual review** based on the rubric above.  
- Evaluations are **subjective but criteria-driven**, ensuring consistency across experiments.  
- This framework supports a wide range of creative, technical, and analytical projects.
