# **Prompt Engineering Lab Journal**

A personal workspace to document 5 projects testing prompt effectiveness.

## 🧠 Objective

To design, test, and evaluate various prompt types to understand how **clarity, tone, structure, and creativity** affect AI-generated outputs.

---

## 📂 Structure

This lab journal contains 5 projects. Each project will include:

1.  **Prompt Type & Goal** – what kind of prompt is tested and why.
2.  **Experiment Setup** – tools, parameters, and method used.
3.  **Prompt Versions** – iterations of the prompt for comparison.
4.  **Evaluation** – clarity, accuracy, creativity, tone, and structure scores.
5.  **Insights & Learnings** – what worked, what didn’t, and takeaways.
